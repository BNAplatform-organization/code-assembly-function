This platform aims at accelerating the frequently used but time-consuming algorithms in neuroscience research
We have accelerated the process of brain network analysis (BNA) with NVIDIA GPUs (Graphic processing unit) and multi-core CPUs. The toolbox provides functions for the construction and the analysis of large networks. Network construction is intended for fMRI data using Pearson’s correlation. Network analysis is general purposed and includes the calculation of clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, network efficiency, and betweenness centrality (and comparisons to Maslov random networks). We accelerate Pearson’s correlation calculation, APSP and betweenness with GPUs. Other functions are implemented on multi-core CPUs.
